<p>Hi! My name is Amelia, and this is a little bit about me. I'm currently trying to learn HTML here 
so my resume is applicable for any job.</p>
<p>I aspire to be a back end developer (and possibly a manager at some point), and I really like writing in bash.</p>
<p> I'd like to try making larger projects, learn networks, manage my own project, and maybe manage a larger project at some point in time.</p>
<p> I'm very passionate about coding and I'd really like to learn more!</p>
